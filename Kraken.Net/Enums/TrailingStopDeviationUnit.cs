For example, if the max deviation is set to 10, the unit is 'PERCENT', and the underlying order is a sell, then the trigger price will never be more then 10% below the trigger signal. Similarly, if the deviation is 100, the unit is 'QUOTE_CURRENCY', the underlying order is a sell, and the contract is quoted in USD, then the trigger price will never be more than $100 below the trigger signal.
